<h2 id="about"> ‚ùì About </h2>
The goal of this project is to provide an alternative to strong eventual consistency models in a
distributed system using multiple primitive data types. The use of conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) 
can be used to prevent single point of failures as well as provide a good model for achieving strong eventual consistency. 
CRDTs are data structures that can be used by applications without the need of a central server. They are able to
communicate with other applications to send and receive data. CRDTs work by using simple
mathematical rules to guarantee strong eventual consistency. CRDTs guarantee that if an application in
the distributed system goes offline, once it comes back online, it will eventually converge to the same
state as all the other applications in the system.
CRDTs can be used in offline systems, peer-to-peer communication networks, or traditional client
to server networks


<h2 id="features"> üìÉ Features </h2>
This libary currently supports a combined of 12 CRDTs. We have also created a Trello-clone that utilizes different CRDTs in this libary
for anyone wanted to create an application using CRDTs in C++ enviroment. 


<h2 id="setup"> ‚öô Set Up </h2>
This libary has only been validated on Linux OS, and support for Windows/MAC will be provided at a later time. To set up 

<h2 id="guide"> üêï‚Äçü¶∫ Guide for CRDT data types</h2>
Each CRDT class has a handler and a metadata class. On each of your server, you create the handler once. To actually instatiate the CRDT data structure use the metadata. To add
the CRDT to the server, add the metadata to the handler. 

<h3> Grow Only Counter </h3>

| Name | Identifier | Supported Operations | Data types supported |
|------|------------|----------|------------|
| Handler | `GCounterSB` | `.updatePayload(uint32_t replicaID, T payload)`, `.updateInternalPayload()`, `.queryId()`, `.queryPayload()`, `.queryPayloadwithID(uint32_t replicaID)`, `.addExternalReplica(std::vector<GCounterMetadata<T>> external_replica_metadata)`, `.updateLocalExternalPayload(std::vector<GCounterSB> handlers)` | `int`, `char` |
| Metadata | `GCounterMetadata` |   `.serialize()`,`.serializeFile(std::string pathToFile)`, `.deserialize(std::string s)`, `.deserializeFile(std::string jsonString)`, `.queryId()`, `.queryPayload()`, `.updatePayload(T payload)`, `.setPayload(T payload)`    | `int`, `char` |


| Supported Operations (Handler) | Functionality | 
|----------|------------|
 `.updatePayload(uint32_t replicaID, T payload) ` | Handler updates metadata by the payload using the ID of the metadata |
`.updateInternalPayload()` | Handler merges all the CRDTs that it contains. Equivalent to doing a localMerge |
 `.queryId()` | Get the id of the handler |
 `.queryPayload()` | Get the total payload for the CRDTs in the handler | 
 `.queryPayloadwithID(uint32_t replicaID)` | Get the payload of the CRDT using the ID of the metadata
 `.addExternalReplica(std::vector<GCounterMetadata<T>> external_replica_metadata)` | Add as many metadatas as you want to the handler. 
 `.updateLocalExternalPayload(std::vector<GCounterSB> handlers)` | Handler fetches all the other handlers and does a merge. Equivalent of doing merge between multiple servers |

| Supported Operations (Metadata) | Functionality | 
|----------|------------|
 `.serialize()`  | Tas Explain |
`.serializeFile(std::string pathToFile)`  | Tas Explain |
`.deserialize(std::string s)` | Tas Explain |
`.deserializeFile(std::string jsonString)` | Tas Explain | 
`.queryId()` | Get the ID of the metadata
`.queryPayload()` | Get the payload of the metadata
`.updatePayload(T payload)` | Update the payload of of the metadata
`.setPayload(T payload)`  | Set the payload of the metadata

<h4> Example </h4>

```cpp
crdt::state::GCounterSB<uint32_t> handler(1); //Represents Server 1 with id = 1
//Create several replicas all with key = 1 creating conflict
crdt::state::GCounterMetadata<uint32_t> replica1A(1,6);
crdt::state::GCounterMetadata<uint32_t> replica1B(1,15);
crdt::state::GCounterMetadata<uint32_t> replica1C(1,8);
crdt::state::GCounterMetadata<uint32_t> replica1D(1,2);
handler.addExternalReplica({replica1A,replica1B,replica1C,replica1D});
cout << handler.queryPayload() //Will print 15
